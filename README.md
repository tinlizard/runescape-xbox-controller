# runescape-xbox-controller
This is some python code I made to make OSRS (old school runescape) work with an xbox controller. You can theoretically also just use Windows/Mac/Linux with an xbox controller with this code. Please first download and install python, the pygame and pyautogui libraries with the pip command (pip install pygame, pip install pyautogui). 

In the windows/linux/macOS terminal please move into the directory where the downloaded python file is and excute it with the command "python OSRS_xbox.py" (do not include the quotation marks). Keep your terminal running in the background while you play runescape and it should work.
